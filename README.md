Xero API wrapper [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/xero-gateway/xero_gateway.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/xero-gateway/xero_gateway) [![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/xero_gateway.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/rb/xero_gateway)
================

# Getting Started

This is a Ruby gem for communicating with the Xero API.
You can find more information about the Xero API at <https://developer.xero.com>.

## Installation

Just add the `xero_gateway` gem to your Gemfile, like so:

```ruby
  gem 'xero_gateway'
```

## Usage

```ruby
  gateway = XeroGateway::Gateway.new(YOUR_OAUTH_CONSUMER_KEY, YOUR_OAUTH_CONSUMER_SECRET)
```

### Authenticating with OAuth

The Xero Gateway uses [OAuth 1.0a](https://oauth.net/core/1.0a/) for authentication. Xero Gateway
implements OAuth in a very similar manner to the [Twitter gem by John Nunemaker](http://github.com/jnunemaker/twitter)
, so if you've used that before this will all seem familiar.

### Authenticating: Public/Partner Applications

Public (or Partner, if you've been through the process to be approved) are traditional three-legged OAuth apps that can be used to access many different Xero accounts.

  1. **Get a Consumer Key & Secret**

  First off, you'll need to get a Consumer Key/Secret pair for your application from Xero.

  Head to <https://api.xero.com>, log in and then click My Applications &gt; Add Application.

  Part of the process for this will ask you for an "OAuth Redirect URL". This is where customers will be redirected once they complete logging in with Xero.

  On the right-hand-side of your application's page there's a box titled "OAuth Credentials". Use the Key and Secret from this box in order to set up a new Gateway instance.

  2. **Create a Xero Gateway in your App**

  ```ruby
    gateway = XeroGateway::Gateway.new(YOUR_OAUTH_CONSUMER_KEY, YOUR_OAUTH_CONSUMER_SECRET)
  ```

  3. **Creating a Request Token**

  You'll then need to get a Request Token from Xero.

  ```ruby
    request_token = gateway.request_token
  ```

  You should keep this around - you'll need it to exchange for an Access Token later. (If you're using Rails, this means storing it in the session or something similar)

  Next, you need to redirect your user to the authorization url for this request token. In Rails, that looks something like this:

  ```ruby
    redirect_to request_token.authorize_url
  ```

  You may also provide a callback parameter, which is the URL within your app the user will be redirected to. You need to ensure that the domain and port match the callback URL you specified in the Xero Developer Center!

  ```ruby
    request_token = request_token(oauth_callback: "https://yourapp.com/xero/callback")
    redirect_to request_token.authorize_url
  ```

  4. **Retrieving an Access Token**

  If you've specified a Callback URL when setting up your application or provided an oauth\_callback parameter on your request token, your user will be redirected to that URL with an OAuth Verifier as a GET parameter. You can then exchange your Request Token for an Access Token like this (assuming Rails, once again):

  ```ruby
    gateway.authorize_from_request(request_token.token, request_token.secret, oauth_verifier: params[:oauth_verifier])
  ```

  (If you haven't specified a Callback URL, the user will be presented with a numeric verifier which they must copy+paste into your application; see examples/oauth.rb for an example)

  Now you can access Xero API methods:

  ```ruby
    gateway.get_contacts
    # => #<XeroGateway::Response:0x007fd367181388 ...
  ```

  #### Storing Access Tokens

  You can also store the Access Token/Secret pair so that you can access
  the API without user intervention. Currently, these access tokens are
  only valid for 30 minutes, and will raise a
  `XeroGateway::OAuth::TokenExpired` exception if you attempt to access the
  API beyond the token's expiry time.

  ```ruby
    access_token, access_secret = gateway.access_token
  ```

  You can authorize a `Gateway` instance later on using the
  `authorize_from_access` method:

  ```ruby
    gateway = XeroGateway::Gateway.new(XERO_CONSUMER_KEY, XERO_CONSUMER_SECRET)
    gateway.authorize_from_access(your_stored_token.access_token, your_stored_token.access_secret)
  ```

 ### Authenticating: Private Applications

Private applications are used to access a single Xero account.

1. **Get a Consumer Key & Secret**

  Head to <https://api.xero.com>, log in and then click My Applications &gt; Add Application.

  You'll need to generate an RSA keypair and an X509 certificate. Follow the instructions [here](https://developer.xero.com/documentation/api-guides/create-publicprivate-key).

  You can then copy `publickey.cer` and paste it into the certificate box (`cat publickey.cer | pbcopy` on a Mac :apple:)

  Make sure you keep `privatekey.pem` about, as you'll need it to connect to Xero in your app.

2. **Create a Xero Gateway in your App**

  It's as easy as:

  ```ruby
    require 'xero_gateway'
    gateway = XeroGateway::PrivateApp.new(YOUR_OAUTH_CONSUMER_KEY, YOUR_OAUTH_CONSUMER_SECRET, PATH_TO_YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY)

    pp gateway.get_contacts
  ```

  Note that for private apps, your consumer key and secret do double duty as your access token and secret pair :)

## Examples

Open `examples/oauth.rb` and change `CONSUMER_KEY` and `CONSUMER_SECRET` to
the values for a Test OAuth Public Application in order to see an example of
OAuth at work.

There's also `examples/private_app.rb` if you'd like to see an example private app.

If you're working with Rails, a controller similar to this might come in
handy:

```ruby
  class XeroSessionsController < ApplicationController

    before_action :get_xero_gateway

    def new
      session[:request_token]  = @xero_gateway.request_token.token
      session[:request_secret] = @xero_gateway.request_token.secret

      redirect_to @xero_gateway.request_token.authorize_url
    end

    def create
      @xero_gateway.authorize_from_request(session[:request_token], session[:request_secret],
                                           oauth_verifier: params[:oauth_verifier])

      session[:xero_auth] = { access_token:   @xero_gateway.access_token.token,
                              access_secret:  @xero_gateway.access_token.secret }

      session.data.delete(:request_token)
      session.data.delete(:request_secret)
    end

    def destroy
      session.data.delete(:xero_auth)
    end

    private

      def get_xero_gateway
        @xero_gateway = XeroGateway::Gateway.new(YOUR_OAUTH_CONSUMER_KEY, YOUR_OAUTH_CONSUMER_SECRET)
      end

  end
```

Note that I'm just storing the Access Token + Secret in the session here - you could equally store them in the database if you felt like
refreshing them every 30 minutes ;)

## API Methods

You can find a full listing of all implemented methods on [the wiki page](https://github.com/xero-gateway/xero_gateway/wiki/API-Methods).

## Logging

You can specify a logger to use (so you can track down those tricky
exceptions) by using:

```ruby
  gateway.logger = ActiveSupport::BufferedLogger.new("log_file_name.log")
```

Your logger simply needs to respond to `info`.
